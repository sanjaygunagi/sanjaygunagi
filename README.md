# 👋 Hi, I'm Sanjay Gunagi 👨‍💻

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a Senior Software Engineer with a strong foundation in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Experienced in collaborating with cross-functional teams to design, develop, and maintain software solutions. Adept at working independently with a focus on frontend development, delivering projects ranging from small applications to enterprise-level solutions.

I’m passionate about delivering high-quality software that users love and that businesses can rely on. Whether it’s improving existing features or creating something from scratch, I focus on writing clean, maintainable code and always keep the user experience front and center. I also believe in the power of mentoring, sharing knowledge, and working as part of a collaborative team to achieve the best results.
